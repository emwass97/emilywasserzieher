<font size=5>Get to know me more!</font?\>
<p>
<font size=4>Since I've been employed with Studio Three, I've found my passion in the world of fitness. As I myself, have lost well over fifty pounds, which is why I want to help others do the same. Which is why I'm pursuing a degree specifically in marketing and exercise science, because my goal is to work my way up to a corporate position with Studio Three to help deliver safe and effective workouts for anyone that comes into our community. Though since that is my current long-term goal, my short term goal currently is to finish obtaining my undergraduate degree. Which, will hopefully lead me to an intern position with my company upon graduation.</font?\>
